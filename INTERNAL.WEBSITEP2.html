				text-align:center;">Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise, 
				centered on a film series created by George Lucas. It depicts the adventures
				of various characters "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away". The first film in the series,
				Star Wars (later subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope), was released on May 25,
				1977 by 20th Century Fox and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. It was
				followed by the similarly successful sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and 
				Return of the Jedi (1983); these three films constitute the original Star Wars trilogy. 
				A prequel trilogy was later released between 1999 and 2005, which received a more mixed reaction
				from critics and fans, compared to the original trilogy. All seven films were nominated for or won
				Academy Awards, and were commercial successes, with a combined box office revenue of $4.38 billion,
				making Star Wars the fourth highest-grossing film series. The series has spawned an extensive media franchise—the Star
				Wars expanded universe—including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books, resulting in significant
				merchandising franchise." In 2012, the total value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated at USD $30.7 billion, including box-office
				receipts as well as profits from their video games and DVD sales. </p>
