        Naruto uses a bizarre photograph of himself in his Ninja Registration Form. The Third Hokage tells him to retake his photo, as the photograph made him seem senseless, but Naruto used his Sexy Technique in order to frustrate him. A child tries to attack the Hokage but trips on his own scarf. A ninja arrives and seems concerned for the child. He notices Naruto, identifying him as the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox. The child claims that Naruto made him fall, trying to deny the fact that he falls over himself. Naruto disputes with the child but the ninja, Ebisu, tells him that the child is the grandson of the Third Hokage; revealing him to be Konohamaru Sarutobi. Ebisu then tells Konohamaru to train with him so he will be Hokage quicker, but the boy slips away during Ebisu's speech to follow Naruto. Ebisu panics and leaves swiftly. Konohamaru follows Naruto through Konohagakure, trying to avoid being spotted. After Naruto sees through his obvious disguise, Konohamaru ordered Naruto to train and teach him how to overthrow the Third Hokage.

After doing various steps of the training Naruto asked Konohamaru why he is obsessed with the Hokage. Konohamaru tells him that the people never identified him as himself and just sees him as the Hokage's grandson. Konohamaru wants to be Hokage, but Naruto tells him that it is not easy to become one.

At the rooftops of the Hokage mansion, Iruka asks the Hokage about Naruto's ninja registration form. The Hokage explains that he has issued a decree not to let anybody know the fact that Naruto is a jinchÅ«riki, and he would punish any who would break it. He also says that the Fourth Hokage wants the village to see Naruto as a hero, but most of the villagers saw Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself.

Ebisu finally finds Konohamaru and Naruto. Konohamaru announces that he was trying to learn the way to beat his grandfather so he could become Hokage. Ebisu taunts Konohamaru, who responds by using the Sexy Technique on him which distracts him. Then Naruto uses his Shadow Clone Technique while The Hokage watches them with his Telescope Technique. Naruto transforms the clones into nude women with the Sexy Technique, causing Ebisu to have a huge nose bleed and fall unconscious. Naruto tells Konohamaru that there is no shortcut to be Hokage, announcing that they would be rivals and that they would fight one day for the title of Hokage
