				<U>SUMMARY</U> <BR><BR>
        
        Twelve years ago, a vicious tailed beast known as the 
        Nine-Tails, attacked the shinobi village of Konohagakure.
        Many shinobi fought the beast, but it defeated and killed
        all those that stood in front of it. Luckily, the town
        was saved when the village's leader, the Fourth Hokage,
        sealed the beast with an infant boy at the cost of his own life.
<br><br>
In the present, Naruto Uzumaki is a prankster who is constantly
causing trouble throughout Konohagakure, most recently having 
placed graffiti all over the Hokage Rock. Much of the village
dislikes him for it, but he enjoys the attention garnered from
reprimands, as he had no parents or friends due to the villagers
abusing him daily for no apparent reason. Despite claiming to
be a talented shinobi who would someday become Hokage, Naruto
is incapable of performing basic techniques such as the Clone 
Technique. When this leaves him unable to graduate from the 
Academy, one of his instructors, Mizuki, tells Naruto that if
he could steal the Scroll of Seals and learn one of its secret
techniques, he would be allowed to continue on to the ranks of
the ninja anyway and graduate.
<br><br>
After successfully stealing the scroll, Naruto is caught by 
another instructor, Iruka Umino, who realised that Naruto had
been tricked by Mizuki. Mizuki arrives and asks Naruto's for
the scroll, to which Iruka ordered Naruto not to, as Mizuki
lied and only wanted the scroll for himself. Mizuki then tells
Naruto that he wasn't the one lying, explaining that the reason
the villagers hate him such much is due to the Nine-Tails that
had been sealed inside him since the day he was born. He goes 
on to explain that Iruka, whose parents were killed by the
Nine-Tails, must hate him the most. However, Iruka refutes
the accusation, saying he did not blame Naruto for the beast's
actions, and that in fact he, having grown up also craving 
attention, sympathised with him. Naruto believing Iruka,
uses his newly-mastered Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat Mizuki.
<br><br>
Amazed by the complicated technique that Naruto has learned,
Iruka officially makes Naruto a ninja by giving him his own
forehead protector, and notes that he may one day have the potential to become Hokage.
